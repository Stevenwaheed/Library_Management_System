## Issues / Challenges
 
1. Tracking the logic of the problem.
   Resolved by reviewing main the points of Library Management System like (add, remove, reserve and search) and try to implement each operation using Java.
 
2. Ensuring that each variable has an appropriate data type and that each method returns a consistent output, so that the code is reliable and maintainable.
   Resolved by test each method, variable and all code components to see their data type and make sure their matching.
 
3. Connecting all methods together.
   Overcame by tracking the logic of the problem, the output of each method call.
